# Mini React

A lightweight, educational implementation of React's core rendering mechanism from scratch.

## Features

- Custom fiber reconciliation algorithm
- Simplified state management
- Functional component support
- Basic hooks implementation

## Why This Project?

This project demonstrates how React's fundamental rendering and component lifecycle work under the hood by reimplementing key concepts.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lomri123/mini-react-engine.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run example
npm start
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand React's rendering process
- Learn about fiber architecture
- Explore state management techniques
- Dive into component lifecycle

## Key Components

- `fiber.js`: Core reconciliation logic
- `hooks.js`: State and effect management
- `render.js`: Rendering pipeline
- `state.js`: Centralized state management

## Limitations

This is a learning project and not intended for production use.
